# Number-Tracker
This is a Number Tracker created with Python 

It does not do much really, Just enter the Phone Number and hit track button to find out things like:

1. Country of the number
2. Service Provider Of the Number
3. Timezone of the Number
4. Longitude and Latitude
5. Current City on a Map


PS: Always enter country code before Number
e.g. +234-phonenumber, +233-phone number

As without country code it would display an error

I really hope to create a NUMBER TRACKER 2.0, A more better version than this soon

Love you all!ðŸ˜˜
